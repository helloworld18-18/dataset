Below is your complete theory ONLY related to regression and this house price prediction practical.

THEORY: Predicting House Prices Using Regression
1. Introduction

Machine Learning (ML) enables computers to learn from data and make predictions without explicit programming.

Among ML techniques, Regression is widely used for predicting continuous numerical values, such as house prices, salary, rainfall, or stock market values.

In this practical, we build a Linear Regression model to predict house prices from past historical data.

2. What is Regression?

Regression is a supervised learning algorithm that models the relationship between one or more independent variables (features) and a dependent variable (target).

Its goal is to predict continuous values such as prices, weights, temperature.

It helps understand how features such as bedrooms, bathrooms, and area influence house prices.

The general mathematical formula of linear regression is:

𝑦
=
𝑏
0
+
𝑏

𝑥

y = predicted price

𝑥

𝑏

 = coefficients (model-learned weights)

𝑏
0
b

	​

 = intercept

Error term represents the difference between actual and predicted values

3. Why Use Regression for House Price Prediction?

House prices depend on multiple measurable factors such as number of bedrooms, area, floors, etc.

Regression can model the relationship between these features and price.

It helps in:

Real estate price estimation

Property value forecasting

Decision-making in banking and housing loans

4. Steps Involved in This Practical
Step 1: Load the Dataset

The dataset contains features like:

Bedrooms

Bathrooms

Area in sq ft

Floors

Price

Dataset is loaded using pandas.read_csv().

Step 2: Preprocessing

We separate:

X (independent variables) = features

y (dependent variable) = price

Ensure no missing values.

Step 3: Train-Test Split

Data is split into:

Training Data (80%) → model learns

Testing Data (20%) → model performance tested

We use train_test_split() from scikit-learn.

Step 4: Model Training

We use the LinearRegression class from scikit-learn.

Model learns the best-fit line that reduces error.

Step 5: Prediction

Model predicts house prices on:

Test dataset

New unseen house feature values

Step 6: Evaluation

Common metrics:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

R² Score

Lower MSE, Higher R² → better model.

Step 7: Visualization (Optional)

Scatter plot to see actual vs predicted prices.

5. Applications of Regression in Real Life

Real Estate – predicting house/land prices.

Business – forecasting demand and revenue.

Health – predicting disease progression.

Finance – stock market price predictions.

6. Advantages of Regression

Simple and easy to implement.

Good for understanding feature importance.

Works well for linear relationships.

Fast training time even on large datasets.

7. Limitations of Regression

Assumes a linear relationship between variables.

Sensitive to outliers.

Cannot capture complex patterns unless extended (polynomial).

# 5. Predict on test data
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
print("\nPredicted Prices:\n", predictions[:5])


new_house = pd.DataFrame({
    'bedrooms': [3],
    'bathrooms': [2],
    'sqft_living': [1800],
})

new_price = model.predict(new_house)

✅ 5. Line-by-Line Explanation (Every Word Explained)
Importing Libraries

import pandas as pd → loads pandas library for reading and handling datasets.
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split → splits data into train & test.
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression → imports regression model.

Loading Dataset

df = pd.read_csv("house_prices.csv")

pd.read_csv() → reads CSV file

"house_prices.csv" → file name
df.head() → prints first 5 rows.

Selecting Features

X = df[['bedrooms', 'bathrooms', 'sqft_living']]

X contains input features.

y = df['price']

y contains output (target) values.

Train-Test Split

train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

80% → training

20% → testing

Model Training

model = LinearRegression()

creates regression model object
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

trains model using training data

Prediction

model.predict(X_test)

predicts prices for test dataset

New House Prediction

new_house = [[3, 2, 1800]]

you can change numbers
model.predict(new_house)

predicts price of the new house

✅ 7. Conclusion

In this practical, we successfully built a Linear Regression model to predict house prices using features such as bedrooms, bathrooms, and square footage. The model was trained on real-world housing data, and predictions were made for both test data and a new user-defined house. This experiment shows how regression can be used in real estate price forecasting using Machine Learning.
